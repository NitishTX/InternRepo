# Railway Booking System

_It is a simple project which is helping user in booking a train ticket. This project created to apply the learnings of Object Oriented Programming_

### Description
- The user has a menu, in which he/she has to enter the details as asked and the booking of the train would be confirmed.
- The constraint of reducing of seat numbers after booking has been considered.

### Learnings
1. I have learned to manipulate the dataframe with the help of Pandas.

### Drawbacks of the project
1. It doesn't have many trains in the dataset.
2. It allows user to enter anything, which is not preferable for the system when deployed.

### Future Scope
1. Require a good user interface, which takes only required data.
